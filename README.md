This is a infinite scroll project.

As you scroll, and get closer to the bottom, fetch API will make a request to the Unsplash API to access more images and the images will be appended into the HTML

There is a loading animation that plays when the images are loaded for the very first time.

Overall it was a fun project and I learned about how to use API key and how to use APIs to fetch data and then convert it to JSON and then the extract the desired information from it.
